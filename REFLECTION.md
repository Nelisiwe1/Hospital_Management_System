# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

1. **Conflicting Priorities:** Some stakeholders, like IT staff, prioritize security, while others, like patients, prioritize ease of access. Finding a balance between security and usability was challenging.
2. **Scalability vs. Cost:** The system must handle peak usage efficiently without increasing infrastructure costs significantly. This required careful architectural planning.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with HIPAA and POPIA added complexity, particularly in terms of data storage and encryption.
4. **User Training Needs:** Some stakeholders (e.g., older patients) may struggle with technology, necessitating an intuitive design and training materials.
5. **System Performance:** Doctors and nurses require real-time data access, making system performance optimization critical while maintaining security protocols.

By addressing these challenges, the system ensures a **well-balanced and effective solution** for all stakeholders.
